# My personal website and blog.  
This is my personal website and blog using the static site generator Jekyll. This is entirely custom made without a theme for the primary purpose of learning and experimenting with new tools. But I felt that my blog should be an expression of my personal creativity, my hobbies, and programming profession, and therefore not just one of the commonly used simple minimalist themes.
