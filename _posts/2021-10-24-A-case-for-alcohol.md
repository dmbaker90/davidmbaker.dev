I finished reading Drunk: How We Sipped, Danced, and Stumbled Our Way to Civilization by Edward Slingerland.  In my view it makes 2 distinct arguments regarding alcohol:
* That alcohol was foundational to forming civilization, and without it we would not be where we are today and in fact we might not even have been incentivized to develop agriculture - the backbone of civilization.
* While alcohol may rightly have a bad rap regarding its health effects, the psychosocial benefits are significant and for most of us significantly beneficial.
